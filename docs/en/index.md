fish-speech is completely new version of TTS model based on LLM. Our model uses 300,000 hours of high-quality Chinese, Japanese, and English audio data to achieve 44.1kHz high-fidelity audio generation quality, and the maximum length of speech generation is up to 10min.

The data source for fish-speech comes from Genshin Impact, Hongkai Starrail and some other ACGN content, thanks to XXX, XXX for the dataset.

Mature Travelers, Pathfinders, Captains, Doctors, sensei, Demon Hunters, Meowlu, and V should refer to this document to learn how to train on their own.
